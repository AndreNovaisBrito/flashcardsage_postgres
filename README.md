# Full Stack Mern App

## Why?

I Wrote this project 2 times with different databases.
It really helped me understanding the whole full-stack
environment from a bird's eye view. It also removed a
lot of unfamiliarity with VSCode, it's plugins,
also how to setup Typescript, how the compilation works,
Why people use Typescript instead of Javascript and much more.

I wrote this app with Cloud MongoDB, then Postgres.
